**Titanic Survival Prediction System**

**README**

**Overview:**
This project aims to predict whether a person would survive the sinking of the Titanic based on various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and by analyzing the available data on the passengers aboard, we can develop a predictive model to understand the factors that influenced survival rates.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers including their socio-economic status (class), age, gender, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is publicly available and can be found on platforms like Kaggle.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

**Installation:**
1. Install Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```

**Usage:**
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Place the Titanic dataset file (CSV format) in the project directory.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```
   python titanic_survival_prediction.py
   ```
5. Follow the instructions provided by the program to input passenger details for prediction.

**Approach:**
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare features for model training.
2. Feature Selection: Relevant features such as socio-economic status, age, and gender are selected for model training.
3. Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests are trained on the dataset.
4. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using cross-validation techniques to assess their performance in predicting survival.
5. Prediction: The user can input details of a passenger, and the trained model predicts whether the passenger would survive or not based on the provided information.
